description: Compare two architectural patterns for your codebase

## Context

Analyze codebase characteristics and compare: $1 vs $2

## Task

Provide detailed comparison:

| Aspect | $1 | $2 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Complexity | | |
| Testability | | |
| Scalability | | |
| Team learning curve | | |
| Migration effort | | |

For your specific codebase:
1. Which pattern fits better and why
2. Hybrid approach possibilities
3. Incremental adoption path
4. Risk assessment for each
