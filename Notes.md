## General Notes
- Skills should handle mechanical generation, not decisions
- Skills reduce noise so the agent focuses on decisions.
- claude.md file triggered every time you make a prompt
- include 'use Read tool' in prompt when you want it to read through a guide or docs. Include 'use Task tool' when you want it to invoke a sub agent
